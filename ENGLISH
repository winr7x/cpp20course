This is the idea I want to [convey] here - передать - kənˈveɪ

The compiler transforms the header into a [legit] module interface - законный - ləˈdʒɪt

I will probably [redo] thish chapter - переделаю

[That being said], it is possible to use other tools                               53. 570. 12:54

we [might] not have covered yet - возможно                                         53. 570. 5:56

that definition is going to [show up] in those multiple files - появлятья          53. 570. 1:59

we can [print out] if a number is signed or unsigned

i really hope this [makes sense]                                                   https://youtu.be/8jLOx1hD3_o?t=24332

this is something you need to [be aware of] - быть осведомленным                   https://youtu.be/8jLOx1hD3_o?t=24934

we are going [to recap] what we saw in the chapter - резюмировать                  https://youtu.be/8jLOx1hD3_o?t=25180

expression here which is going to be what we're going to be [switching over]       https://youtu.be/8jLOx1hD3_o?t=27197

"switch" and "switch over have the same meaning. The use of additional prepositions such as the "over" in this case generally sound more colloquial.

we [basically] print every other case after the Marker case is hit - в сущности    https://youtu.be/8jLOx1hD3_o?t=27534

'for loops' like this and it may look [intimidating] for first users - устрашающе  https://youtu.be/8jLOx1hD3_o?t=28550
